v0.1

Automated game of war.

I was out with some friends and two of them started playing a game of war. After about a half hour, neither person seemed close to winning. As war is an entirely deterministic game, I decided to go home and build an automated version so that next time they want to play, they can just jump to the end and see who won.

to do
=====
- add endgame victory statement
- clean up round vicotry conditions
- allow for more than 2 players
- deal with war if one player doesn't have enough cards to put down
- html interface
- graph: y = number of cards in hand, x = round
